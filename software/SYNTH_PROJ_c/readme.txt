This was a project that I had done for SUNY New Paltz EGC493 - System on Chip.

Using an Altera DE2-115 Development board, speakers, and a PS/2 keyboard, I created a basic audio synthesizer. This was based off of a lab in the user manual.

The end results allows a PS/2 keyboard to play the seven standard notes in a scale (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) and the sharps (C#, D#, F#, G#, A#). The keys on the keyboard match up to the notes based on the chart below:

+=============================+
|   NOTE        |   KEYPRESS  |
+===============+=============+
|     C         |      A      |
|     C#        |      W      |
|     D         |      S      |
|     D#        |      E      |
|     E         |      D      |
|     F         |      F      |
|     F#        |      T      |
|     G         |      G      |
|     G#        |      Y      |
|     A         |      H      |
|     A#        |      U      |
|     B         |      J      |

This project works by playing a tone (generated by a sinewave at a certain frequency) when a key is pressed. The tones are stored in an array of size 24000. Each index represents a value that would be a point on the line of the generated sinewave. This is streamed through the audio registers and out the output jack on the development board.
